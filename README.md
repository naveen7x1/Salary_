# Employee Salary Prediction

This project predicts employee salaries using a linear regression model trained on employee data. It includes a Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training, and a Streamlit app for making predictions.

## Features

- Data analysis and visualization (Jupyter Notebook)
- Linear regression model for salary prediction
- Streamlit web app for interactive predictions

## Files

- `Analysis_modelling.ipynb` — Data analysis, visualization, and model training notebook
- `app.py` — Streamlit app for salary prediction
- `linearmodel.pkl` — Saved linear regression model (generated by the notebook)
- `Employees.xlsx` — Employee dataset (not included here, add your own)

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd employee
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib streamlit joblib
```

### 3. Prepare the data

Place your `Employees.xlsx` file in the project directory.

### 4. Train the model (optional)

Open `Analysis_modelling.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells to analyze data and (re)train the model. This will generate `linearmodel.pkl`.

### 5. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
